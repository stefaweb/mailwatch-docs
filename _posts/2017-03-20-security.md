## Security related instructions

### Reporting a Security Issue
If you think that you have found a security issue in MailWatch, don't use the bug tracker and don't publish it publicly. Instead, all security issues must be sent to security [at] mailwatch.org. Emails sent to this address are forwarded to the MailWatch core-team private email.
